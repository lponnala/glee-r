As of May 2015, this is a fully functional package written in pure R (no C++ code anywhere). See the "check-results" folder for an example run. The output matches that obtained using the old Rcpp code. 

It has also been packaged into a [shiny-app](https://github.com/lponnala/glee-r/tree/master/shiny-app) hosted at: [http://lponnala.shinyapps.io/glee](http://lponnala.shinyapps.io/glee)
