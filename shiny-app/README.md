### Current status (as of May 2015)

- this is a fully working shiny app written using pure R code (no C++) hosted at http://lponnala.shinyapps.io/glee
- tested for output correctness using the same data that was used in the gleeR repo, see "check-output" folder
- checked locally using shiny::runApp()
- works on shinyapps.io too, but the progress bar gets hidden by the RStudio banner at the top of the page
